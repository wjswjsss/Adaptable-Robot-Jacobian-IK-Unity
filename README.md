这是一个运行在Unity上的Jacobian based IK Solver, 来自[jiafei1224](https://github.com/jiafei1224)的[AR2-D2 project](https://github.com/jiafei1224/AR2-D2)，非常感谢他们团队的工作，他们真的做的非常棒。其代码原本是一个给Franka Emika Panda机械臂设计的IK Solver（代码在`Panda/`），我成功的将其适配到了UR3e机械臂上，目前运行的不错（代码在`UR/`）。我在此分享我做出的改动。若是您需要一个Jacobian based IK Solver, 我的经历或许可以帮到你。我制作了一个[prompt](./ADAPTATION_GUIDE.md)，可以直接扔给AI, 让AI帮助您做出针对性改动。 

This is a Jacobian-based IK Solver running in Unity, derived from the [AR2-D2 project](https://github.com/jiafei1224/AR2-D2) by [jiafei1224](https://github.com/jiafei1224). A huge thank you to their team for their incredible work. Originally designed for the Franka Emika Panda arm (files in `Panda/`), I have successfully adapted it for the UR3e robotic arm, which is now performing well (files in `UR/`). I’m sharing my modifications here in hopes that this might help if you're looking for a Jacobian-based IK solver. I have also prepared an [AI adaptation prompt](./ADAPTATION_GUIDE.md) that you can directly provide to an AI assistant to help you make customized adjustments for your own setup.
